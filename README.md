I've always wanted my own candy vending machine and thought it would be a fun challenge to make one.

This is a candy wheel stack consisting of (bottom up):
- Receiver / Dispenser
- Stepper Motor Assembly with Stepper Motor
- Candy Wheel Base and Candy Wheel
- Hopper / Brush Assembly with Brushes
- Hopper Lid

Motor Details:
- Model 28BYJ 48 5V 4-Phase Stepper Motor (2048 Steps)
- Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HCS369F

Other Vending System Components
- Coin Acceptor Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y45XMQ7
- Arduino Nano (common)
- 12-Digit Starburst Display (unavailable, from a long closed surplus store)
- +12 and +5 power supply

About the Print
- Printed with PLA on a QIDI X-Plus at 0.4mm resolution.

About the Hopper Brushes
-I designed the Hopper/Brush unit to use springs, but the weakest ones I could find were still too much for the weak stepper motor. 
- Instead, for each, I cut 1 1/4" of 1/4" clear heat shrink tubing, and used scissors to make four cuts in one end to flare the ends making a sort-of brush. See the pictures. 
- Right-sized paint brushes might work as well if they can be made to stay in place.
